# The Solar System
This project includes python code for Programming assignment 5 in T-511-TGRA
at Reykjavik University. This is not a game since no real game mechanics are implemented.
The "game" models our solar system with all 8 planets and a spaceship jumping around. All
the planets are in real size related to each other and at the correct relative distance from
the sun but the sun itself is a lot smaller than in reality since it is quite massive.
They also rotate at the correct speed around the sun and around themselves but not exactly 
in relation to the speed at which they spin around the sun. 
The controls are quite simple allowing for a very basic spectator navigation but also allowing 
the camera to be locked around any of the 8 planets or 1 spaceship using the 1-9 keys on the
keyboard. Once locked Q and E can be used to rotate around the planet or spaceship. All planet
textures are in 2k except for the earth which is in 8k, has a specular map, clouds and a dark
side texture as well.
